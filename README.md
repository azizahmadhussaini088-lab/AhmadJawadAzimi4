A very interactive 6-page React site (Create React App) with:
- React Router for pages (Home, Services, Projects, Skills, About, Contact)
- Framer Motion animations and page transitions
- Tailwind-ready configuration (tailwind + postcss files included)
- RTL-friendly layout and Persian text snippets

## Quick start

1. Extract the ZIP and open terminal inside the project folder
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

If you encounter `could not read package.json` error, ensure you are inside the project folder that contains package.json before running `npm install`.
